If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
So ripped off, so stepped on
You're not the only one refusing to back down
You're not the only one, so get up
Let's start a riot
A riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot
A riot
Let's start a riot
If you feel so filthy
So dirty, so fucked up
If you feel so walked on
So painful, so pissed off
You're not the only one refusing to go down
You're not the only one, so get up
Another night I'm barely holdin' on
Another night I'm barely holdin' on
